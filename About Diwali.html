            About Diwali
        </h3>
        <p>
            Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/; Deepavali[3] (IAST: dīpāvalī) or Divali; related to Jain Diwali, Bandi Chhor Divas, Tihar, Swanti, Sohrai and Bandna) is a festival of lights and is
             one of the major festivals celebrated by Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs.[4] The festival usually lasts five days and is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika 
             (between mid-October and mid-November).[5][6][7] One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil,
              and knowledge over ignorance".[8][9][10][11] The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity and Ganesha, god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles, with
               many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. 
               Furthermore, it is a celebration of the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon Ravana in Lanka and 
               serving 14 years of exile.
               Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/)[5] or Divali[39] is from the Sanskrit dīpāvali meaning "row or series of lights".[40][41] The term is derived from the Sanskrit words dīpa, "lamp,
                light, lantern, candle, that which glows, shines, illuminates or knowledge"[42] and āvali, "a row, range, continuous line, series".[43][c]
            The five-day celebration is observed every year in early autumn after the conclusion of the summer harvest. It coincides with the new moon (amāvasyā) and is deemed the darkest 
            night of the Hindu lunisolar calendar.[44] The festivities begin two days before amāvasyā, on Dhanteras, and extend two days after, on the second day of the month of Kartik.[45] 
            (According to Indologist Constance Jones, this night ends the lunar month of Ashwin and starts the month of Kartik[46] – but see this note[d] and Amanta and Purnima systems.) The
             darkest night is the apex of the celebration and coincides with the second half of October or early November in the Gregorian calendar.[46] The festival climax is on the third day
              and is called the main Diwali. It is an official holiday in a dozen countries, while the other festive days are regionally observed as either public or optional restricted holidays
               in India.[48] In Nepal, it is also a multiday festival, although the days and rituals are named differently, with the climax being called the Tihar festival by Hindus and Swanti 
               festival by Buddhists.[49][50]
